 *      NOTE: when using the buffer with the EFM32LG the use of the buffer
 *      was causing some hard faults. It's not sure whether the problem relies in this
 *      implementation or in the libraries provided by Energy Micro that deal with
 *      memory management (or some conflict with another function).
